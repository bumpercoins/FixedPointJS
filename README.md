# FixedPointJS
This is the custom Q15.16 Fixed Point number class I created for use in my game, [BumperCoins](https://bumpercoins.io/).

It implements basic arithmetic operations and square root.

## The Files
1. FixedPoint.ts is the main file, the FixedPoint class
2. TestFixedPoint.ts is a test file that shows FixedPoint.ts usage
3. FixedPoint.txt is a file that's largely for myself where I workout and reason about the underlying math.

## Setup
Basically the FixedPoint.ts file is self-contained and can be dropped into any TypeScript project.

Here's the commands I use to compile and run the tests on the command line:
```
tsc  --lib "dom, es6" *.ts
node TestFixedPoint.js
```

## License/Attributions
So I don't care how this particular FixedPoint code is used at all. That said, I did sort of port some code from FixedMath.Net/libfixmath (https://github.com/asik/FixedMath.Net), namely code for multiplication and division.  I also used square root code presented in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Digit-by-digit_calculation). See FixedPoint.txt for my explanations and derivations for everything I used. While I don't believe short and simple Math algorithms can really be copyrighted, I'm not a lawyer so to be safe, I'll copy and paste the [License](https://github.com/asik/FixedMath.Net/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) from FixedMath.Net:
